# Dockerizing a Node.js Application: Giving a sysadmin a fish for the day

This discussion for you if you, no matter what side of the server-side JavaScript line you walk. Are you a developer who has full control of your environments from end-to-end? This talk will appeal to your need for self-contained environmental rollouts. Are you an enterprise developer? Answer your compliance officers with a "VM" which they just need to host and lock down to their heart's content; no need to explain that JavaScript is more than a web browser only thing!

Above all else, shipping is everybody's business. Use containerization technology to ship your code.
